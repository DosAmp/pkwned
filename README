pkwned: Proof of Concept for CVE-2021-4034

This PoC will run PAYLOAD_PATH (as defined in constants.h) with root
privileges from a vulnerable version of pkexec running on glibc. The
directory "GCONV_PATH=." needs to contain an executable file named after the
directory containing the gconv module.

As outlined in the Qualys advisory [1], this will produce a syslog message.
I found two approaches so far to prevent that:

* By using g_find_program_in_path, pkexec does an access() check using
  g_file_test and another explicit one afterwards, which enables a race
  condition (by deleting "GCONV_PATH=./gconv" in between) to call
  g_printerr without log_message:

641	if (access (path, F_OK) != 0)
642	  {
643	    g_printerr ("Error accessing %s: %s\n", path, g_strerror (errno));
644	    goto out;
645	  }

* If pkexec can be prevented from reading /etc/shells through creative use of
  mount namespaces, this will also error out without logging:

356	if (!g_file_get_contents ("/etc/shells",
357	                          &contents,
358	                          NULL, /* gsize *length */
359	                          &error))
360	  {
361	    g_printerr ("Error getting contents of /etc/shells: %s\n", error->message);
362	    g_error_free (error);
363	    goto out;
364	  }

Note that GLib has merged a fix for g_find_program_in_path (probably for next
stable versions after v2.70.3 and v2.71.0) which will make this exploit
infeasible by always returning actual full paths. [2]
